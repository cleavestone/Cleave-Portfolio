A passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics and professional experience in accounts and data management. My journey into **data analytics** and **machine learning** began with a curiosity for turning raw numbers into meaningful insights, driving decision-making, and optimizing processes. 

Over time, I've equipped myself with a robust skill set in:

- **Programming**: Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Power BI
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Expertise in building applications using GPT-based models and LangChain for tasks like chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Power BI

## :blue[I have worked on exciting projects like:]
- **Medical Chatbot**: An AI-powered chatbot leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation to provide medical query resolution in real time.
- **Multiple Question Generator**: A tool for generating quizzes and practice questions, utilizing GPT-based models for educational content creation.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting Amazon stock prices and air quality indices using machine learning techniques.
- **Web Scraping**: Automating data extraction from platforms like Brighter Monday.
- **Sales Dashboards**: Interactive Power BI dashboards for business insights.
- **Pothole Detection**: Leveraging YOLOv8 for object detection and road safety improvement.

## :blue[What Drives Me]
I thrive on tackling complex data challenges, creating interactive dashboards, and building models that offer actionable insights. My goal is to leverage my analytical skills and expertise in **LLMs** and **machine learning** to create impactful solutions that contribute to organizational success.
